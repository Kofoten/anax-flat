==================================================

A me site made by Rasmus Steen used in the course Design at Blekinge Institute of Technology (BTH) in Sweden.

This site is built using [Anax-Flat](https://github.com/canax/anax-flat), PHP, CSS and HTML.

Anax is the glue, the kernel, needed to use other modules, to make *things* on the web.

Anax is the means (1) to en end (2). For some it may be a project making oneself excel at PHP and framworks (1) to become awesome web programmers (2). For other its a tool (1) to build web things (2).
